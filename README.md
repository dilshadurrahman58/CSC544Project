This project is a part of the CSC544 - Advanced Data Visualization class at The University of Arizona. Here, I have worked with some graphs drawn from the production rules of some context free grammars. I have tried to improve the graphs so that the users can easily relate them with the production rules and understand the grammar better.

First, I have used dot to cluster and color the nodes of the graphs and then I used cola.js and dagre.js to add interactivity to the graph layout. The final layout is implemented using dagre.js.
