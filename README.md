This project is done for the CSC544 - Advanced data visualization class. Here, I have worked with some graphs drawn from the production rules of some context free grammars. I have worked to improve the graphs so that the users can easily relate them with the production rules and understand the grammar. 

First, I have worked with dot to cluster and color the nodes of the graphs and then I used cola.js and dagre.js to add interactivity to the graph layout. The final layout is implemented using dagre.js.
